# GS1 Digital Link, conformant resolvers and more *
For several years, this repo served as a quick start guide for GS1 Digital Link. It has now been superseded by other documents and resources and so most of the content that was here has been removed. The links below should provide what you're looking for;

* The [Quick start guide for GS1 Digital Link](https://ref.gs1.org/docs/2024/digital-link-quick-start-guide) is written for technical staff who have been given the task of "implementing GS1 Digital Link."
* [Connecting barcodes to related information](https://ref.gs1.org/docs/2024/connecting-barcodes-to-related-information) is a general discussion of how you might manage the task of linking a single GS1 barcode to multiple sources of relevant information. It builds on [Best practices for creating your QR Code powered by GS1](https://ref.gs1.org/docs/2023/QR-Code_powered-by-GS1-best-practices).
* [The Barcode Syntax Resource](https://ref.gs1.org/tools/gs1-barcode-syntax-resource/) is a set of production-grade open source tools that allow you to work with GS1 identifiers and barcodes, including those using GS1 Digital Link URI syntax. It includes libraries for use in iOS and Android apps.
* The [GS1 Digital Link URI Syntax](https://ref.gs1.org/standards/digital-link/uri-syntax/) and [GS1-Conformant resolver](https://ref.gs1.org/standards/resolver/) standards are the normative documents.

## Other resources ##
* There's a [9 minute video](https://youtu.be/H2idDJeH3o4) that provides an introduction to the different layers that comprise GS1 Digital Link. This predates the time when the GS1-Conformant resolver was separated out from the original GS1 Digital Link standard but is a useful intro to the concepts. This is complemented by a paper written in 2020 [11 Transferable Principles from GS1 Digital Link](https://gs1.github.io/DigitalLinkDocs/principles/).

## The GS1 Global Office resolver ##
The resolver at `id.gs1.org` operates under strict rules to ensure that any links returned are approved by the brand owner (see the [terms of use](https://www.gs1.org/standards/resolver/terms-of-use)). A staging environment is available.
